abstract: "**Background & Aim:** The World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) recently published that “leadership training has a direct impact on the ability of physicians to make continual system improvements.” Within this goal in mind, the ASPIRE Global Leader Program has been developed. It is a global leadership program aimed at increasing leadership abilities, international collaboration and engagement in Young Doctors Movements. Many (Young) Doctors Movements face difficulties in the recruitment, engagement and empowerment of new members. The aim of this workshop is to provide upcoming and established leaders with the ability to identify the needs for capacity building in their organization.
**Method:** The workshop starts with a 10 minute interactive introduction round of facilitators and participants and an introduction to the ASPIRE program. After a 10 minute presentation on capacity building and the concept of SWOT analysis, participants separate into groups of 6-10 people. It is expected to have a maximum of 30 participants. Each group will choose a facilitator for documenting and presenting the group work. The group will perform a SWOT analysis on an organization of one of the group members. After 20 minutes, the group should pick one weakness/threat and use the resources available to the organization to find possible solutions. After another 20 minutes, these will be presented and discussed for around 20 minutes. In the last 10 minutes, there will be wrap up and feedbacks about the workshops and suggestions for future activities of ASPIRE.
**Conclusion:** In the end of the workshop, we expect participants to have gained skills in identifying possibilities to strengthen their organization."
