abstract: '**Background:** The Austrian primary care system, including general practice, is seen as poorly developed and depends very much on how patients choose to access health care, due to the lack of coordination mechanisms. High utilization of specialists and hospital outpatient departments indicate that the general practitioner (GP) does not always act as point of first contact. However, more specific nationwide data is missing.
**Methods:** To determine the GP’s role as point of first contact, data from the QUALICOPC survey was analysed, including 1598 patients from 184 different GPs in Austria. Patient views as well as GPs perceptions on the GPs role as point of first contact were explored with case reports and analysed for differences depending on the degree of urbanisation of the practice location. Patients were also asked about their first-contact behaviour. First-contact behaviour, patient views and GP-perceptions were analysed for correlation. **Results:** 85.9% of the patients say they have a GP they usually go to first. Within 12 months 80% have seen a specialist at least once without consulting their usual doctor and 25.5% have been to an emergency room. General practitioners were often named as point of first-contact in cases such as stomach-ache (83.7%) or routine-check-ups (83.5%). However ratings were very low in cases concerning psycho-social problems or conditions attributed to a certain specialty like sight disorder (29.4%). Statistical analysis shows significant differences between urban and rural areas in first-contact behaviours as well as patient views and GPperceptions. Ratings were usually higher in areas with a lower degree of urbanisation. Patient views showed a positive correlation with GP-perceptions (r=0,122; p<0,001) and first-contact behaviour (r=0,105; p<0,001). **Conclusion:** GPs are not seen as the point of first contact for some primary care relevant problems. To strengthen the first contact role of the GP and the positive effects that are associated with it, the reasons for this should be analysed and addressed within the health care reform process.'
